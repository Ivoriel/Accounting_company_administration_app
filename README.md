# Accounting_company_administration_app

This is an app that was conceived with an accounting company owner to create tools needed for proper management and
administration of the firms resources. Main goal is to ensure that certain repeated tasks were performed for all clients
necessitating a task tracking service.

The company is currently operating using accounting software that doesn't provide the desired functionalities. Therefore, 
the necessity for a supporting app that will provide the desired tools and data aggregation. Data from the existing SQL 
database used by the accounting software will be utilized by this app as well. Additional database will be added to hold
data specific to the app and its functionalities.
